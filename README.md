# C\_2024\_finel\_proj

## Overview

**C\_2024\_finel\_proj** is a C programming project developed in 2024. The repository contains multiple source and header files, each corresponding to different "teams" (e.g., `blueTeam.c`, `greenTeam.c`, etc.), suggesting a modular design possibly representing various components or functionalities within the project.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

* `source.c`: Likely the main entry point of the application.
* `blueTeam.c` / `blueTeam.h`
* `greenTeam.c` / `greenTeam.h`
* `greyTeam.c` / `greyTeam.h`
* `redTeam.c` / `redTeam.h`
* `DummyTxtFile.txt`: Placeholder or sample text file.

Each team file pair (`.c` and `.h`) presumably encapsulates specific functionalities or modules within the project.
